# Leaner.js

**Leaner.js** is a thin wrapper over the HTML DOM API. Although it contains many features of modern JavaScript frameworks (reactive state, components, etc.), it doesn’t require any special compilers or build tools, and it doesn’t use a virtual DOM so it's very lightweight and efficient.

**Note:** the current version is a proof of concept.
